### Commit message: 
**This is a commit note on what has done till now and what is still remaining**  

### Message:

First of all, the index.html has github and linked svg errors, the relevant style.css is also not linked- the instance that is commited is wrong and I am too exhausted, short on time, and the timline is too complicated to rebase rn so I will simply add the correct index.html and style.css with LWI (last working instance) from the VSCode TIMELINE saves

Second commit note comes after the said commit, with next version information- virsion control for this project feels too much of an overkill for now so we will pivot with these notes in the commit history - original idea btw (like that one time I thought of debt fund as a good money parking strategy... sry, won't get distracted again... probably)
