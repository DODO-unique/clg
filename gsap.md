For navbar:
1. scroll-up activates it
2. top left hambrger should give the sidebar


For sidebar:
1. The scroll is disabled, so overflow:hidden is activated
2. the pointer-events should be set to auto for .overlay
3. slide in through transition
4. apply glow if you want
5. manage opacity
6. sidebar activates by clicking the hamburger
7. NOTE: Add a hover on Links, I have not added any hover effects on any elements, so it is on you
